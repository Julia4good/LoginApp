# LoginApp
Kotlin MVVM boilerplate for external API (PHP/MySQL) authentication

LoginSystemApp: Modular Android AuthenticationüöÄ OverviewThis is the foundational repository for a modern Android mobile application focusing on user authentication. The project implements a robust Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architectural pattern using Kotlin and a reactive UI built with Jetpack Compose.The core feature of this application is a decoupled login flow, which is currently simulated but is structured for immediate integration with a remote backend (such as a PHP/MySQL service running on XAMPP and exposed via ngrok).üìê Architecture: MVVM with ComposeThe application is strictly modularized to separate concerns, making it highly testable and maintainable.LayerResponsibilityKey FilesView (Presentation)Renders the UI and captures user input events.AuthScreen.ktViewModel (Logic/State)Holds the UI state, handles business logic, and manages Coroutines.AuthViewModel.ktModel (Data)Abstraction layer for all data operations (network, database).LoginRepository.ktState (Data Structure)The single source of truth exposed by the ViewModel.AuthState.ktFactory (DI)Facilitates Dependency Injection by creating the ViewModel with the required Repository.AuthViewModelFactory.ktüõ†Ô∏è Current Status (Simulated Login)The app is fully functional with a simulated data layer to demonstrate the MVVM flow.How to Test the Current Version:Run the application on an emulator or physical device.Successful Login: Use the simulated credentials:Username: userPassword: pass123Failed Login: Use any other combination to trigger the error state.The application will display a loading indicator (CircularProgressIndicator) for 2 seconds during the simulated network delay defined in LoginRepository.kt.üîó Next Steps: Connecting to XAMPP via ngrokThe primary goal of the next development phase is to replace the simulated delay(2000) logic in LoginRepository.kt with real HTTPS network calls.Required Steps:Add Dependencies: Integrate a networking library (e.g., Retrofit or Ktor) and Kotlin Coroutines dependencies to build.gradle.Permissions: Add the INTERNET permission to AndroidManifest.xml.Update Repository: Modify the LoginRepository to accept the ngrok HTTPS URL in its constructor.Implement Network Logic: Use the chosen networking library to send POST requests to the XAMPP server's PHP script over the secure ngrok tunnel.
